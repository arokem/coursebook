# Custom Courses

The modules in this course can be mixed and matched to meet your individual requirements. We recommend taking a look at our [calendar][] for a suggested course structure, then adapting it to your needs.


## Open Source

This course is entirely open course, and hosted on [GitHub][]. We encourage you to [fork][] the project and modify the calendar to suit your requirements.

If you do adapt the course, we would love to hear about it!
